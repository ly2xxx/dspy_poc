Two dice are tossed. What is the probability that the sum equals two?

[32m{
  "reasoning": "To calculate the probability, we need to find all possible outcomes where the sum of the dice equals two. The only way this can happen is if both dice show a 1. There are 6 possible outcomes when rolling two dice (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), and (1,6). Only one of these outcomes has a sum of two. Therefore, the probability is 1/6.",

[[ ## context ## ]]
[1] ¬´David Gregory (physician) | David Gregory (20 December 1625 ‚Äì 1720) was a Scottish physician and inventor. His surname is sometimes spelt as Gregorie, the original Scottish spelling. He inherited Kinnairdy Castle in 1664. Three of his twenty-nine children became mathematics professors. He is credited with inventing a military cannon that Isaac Newton described as "being destructive to the human species". Copies and details of the model no longer exist. Gregory's use of a barometer to predict farming-related weather conditions led him to be accused of witchcraft by Presbyterian ministers from Aberdeen, although he was never convicted.¬ª
[2] ¬´Gregory Tarchaneiotes | Gregory Tarchaneiotes (Greek: ŒìœÅŒ∑Œ≥œåœÅŒπŒøœÇ Œ§Œ±œÅœáŒ±ŒΩŒµŒπœéœÑŒ∑œÇ , Italian: "Gregorio Tracanioto" or "Tracamoto" ) was a "protospatharius" and the long-reigning catepan of Italy from 998 to 1006. In December 999, and again on February 2, 1002, he reinstituted and confirmed the possessions of the abbey and monks of Monte Cassino in Ascoli. In 1004, he fortified and expanded the castle of Dragonara on the Fortore. He gave it three circular towers and one square one. He also strengthened Lucera.¬ª
[3] ¬´Gregory of Gaeta | Gregory was the Duke of Gaeta from 963 until his death. He was the second son of Docibilis II of Gaeta and his wife Orania. He succeeded his brother John II, who had left only daughters. Gregory rapidly depleted the "publicum" (public land) of the Duchy of Gaeta by doling it out to family members as grants. Gregory disappears from the records in 964 and was succeeded by his younger brother Marinus of Fondi over the heads of his three sons. It is possible that there was an internal power struggle between factions of the Docibilan family and that Gregory was forced out. On the other hand, perhaps he died and his sons fought a losing battle for their inheritance to Gaeta.¬ª
