[[ ## question ## ]]
Two dice are tossed. What is the probability that the sum equals two?

Respond with the corresponding output fields, starting with the field `[[ ## reasoning ## ]]`, then `[[ ## answer ## ]]` (must be formatted as a valid Python float), and then ending with the marker for `[[ ## completed ## ]]`.

[32m[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
When two dice are tossed, there are 36 possible outcomes. To find the probability that the sum equals two, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes. The only way to get a sum of two is if both dice show a 1. Therefore, there is only one favorable outcome.

[[ ## answer ## ]]
1/36
